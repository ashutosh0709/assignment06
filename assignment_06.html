      Version Control System
    </center>
  </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. Use of Version Control System: A repository: It can be thought as a database of changes. It
      contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the project.
    </li>

    <li> There can be several branches in a version control system, according to the number of collaborators. The branches maintain individuality as the code changes remain in a specified branch(s).</li>

    <li> Developers can combine the code changes when required. Further, they can view the history of changes, go back to the previous version(s) and use/manage code in the desired fashion.</li>

      GIT and GITHUB
    </center>
  </h1>
  <ol>
    <li>The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008</li>
    <li>First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a
      self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.</li>
    <li>Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. Also unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting features are available at no cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making GitHub a popular
      choice for open-source projects).</li>

      GIT Commands
    </center>
  </h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>(1)Git Init:</dt>
    <dd>This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>(2)Git Commit:</dt>
    <dd>Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID. Itâ€™s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to
      find a particular change or understanding the changes.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>(3)Git Merge:</dt>
    <dd>Integrate branches together. git merge combines the changes from one branch to another branch. For example, merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>(4)Git Fork:</dt>
    <dd>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</dd>
